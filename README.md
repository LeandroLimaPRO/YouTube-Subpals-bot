# YouTube-Subpals-bot

What's this? --- A simple bot to automate the process on SubPals.

SubPals is a website which offers you to like and subscribe 20 youtube videos, and you will get 10 new subscribers (it works).

I created a bot using Python and Selenium that completes the task for us.

Register manually at Subpals and then you will be able to run my bot.
